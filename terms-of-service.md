# Terms of Service

When using CTFGuide you agree to the following terms:

**General**
- Any content that you upload to the platform such as comments, lessons, or challenges must not include NSFW content, profanity, or have a harmful impact.
- All challenges must be solved without impacting CTFGuide Infrastructure. This includes the client (ctfguide.com), api (api.ctfguide.com), and terminal (terminal-gateway.ctfguide.com, terminal.ctfguide.com).
- Challenges can not have users attack infrastructure or products that the challenge creator does not own.
- Attached files, links, and images must all be routed through CTFGuide unless given permission beforehand.
- It's hard for us to ensure integrity as there are many ways one could cheat. That being said if you are caught doing so, your account will be terminated.

**API**
- All third-party applications must respect our ratelimits.
- You must never use the token of a user. Any method to collect the token is not permitted either.
